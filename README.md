# REC-Attendance

This is the attendance app I created for my religious community, temporarily published here for the benefit of the CCS faculty’s application review. This is not the exact build but nonetheless shows the vast majority of the code I wrote for this project. The .swift code files can be found in the “Pollux REC Attendance” folder.
